# Index Zero : Setting everything up

In this preliminary chapter, we will be downloading and installing all the necessary tools for the next few chapters.

It is recommended to do everything on Linux. For beginners, we recommend using Linux Mint as the interface is quite close to Windows, and that you will find stable NVIDIA drivers.

Prerequisites for the course :
- Possessing a GitHub account
- `git` on your machine
- Having a C++ compiler on your machine (`g++` for Linux)
- Visual Studio Code with the C/C++ Plugin


### Setting up the necessary tools on Linux Mint / Ubuntu :

You will need to install `g++` if you don't already have it on your machine.
```
sudo apt install build-essential
```

Download VSCode [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (.deb format)


Setup the C++ Extension using the [following guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp)


If you don't already have `git`, install it with the following command :
```
sudo apt install git
```

Once all of this is installed, we are ready to start Index One.
