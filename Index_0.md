# Index Zero : Setting everything up

In this preliminary chapter, we will be downloading and installing all the necessary tools for the next few chapters, that will focus mostly on the basics of programming with Python, how to share your code with Git, and how to use the basic features of the VS Code text editor.

It is recommended to do everything on Linux. For beginners, we recommend using Linux Mint.

### Setting up the necessary tools on Linux Mint

Python will allow us to learn the basics of programming and will be your very first programming language if you've never used it before. It is used pretty much everywhere to varying degrees in all computer science fields. For Linux, you can install the prerequisites with the

Git will allow us to save our work, and is also the de-facto standard for programmers around the world when they need to collaborate and save their work.

Also, we need a place to save our code. I highly recommend creating a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account, which will host our Git repositories which is where our code will live.

And finally we need a tool to write our code with. Even though you could probably use the default Notepad app on your favorite Operating System, this is not what professionals do, and it's certainly not convenient even for students. In this course, we will exclusively use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is the most used IDE in the world right now. It is also free of charge and open-source !
