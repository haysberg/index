## Who is this course for ?

This course is mainly directed to people who want to seriously learn computer science, but are interested in getting a complete coverage of topics that would be covered in a classical CompSci program in university.

## Some advice

- If you have an email address from a university, you could apply for the [GitHub Students program](https://education.github.com/pack), which will give you access to a lot of free stuff !
- The course is made to be processed in a specific order ! You can of course do what you want but it was not meant to be taken in a different way.
- You will sometimes (maybe often) feel overwhelmed with the amount of content that is in the course. It's perfectly normal !
- Take your time. Stressing out and trying to rush things never works when working with computers.
- If you feel stuck on something, take some time off and do something else. Work on a different problem, cook some food, go for a walk, anything really.
