# Index One : Basics of programming & Linux

The first index will give you courses to learn C++, your first programming language !
We will add some other things on top like the Linux command-line and Git.

A good video course to follow while you do this Index : [Modern C++](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLgnQpQtFTOGR50iIOtO36nK6aNPtVq98C)

The course will teach you about the basics of using Linux. The commands used in the course are the same that you will use in Linux Mint so don't be afraid if you don't run Ubuntu.

You will also learn C++ on Linux which is a very big plus.

**Make sure to take your time** because a lot of what we will do later will be based on concepts learnt here. You don't have to rush anything as this represents a lot of work for someone just starting.

Keep in mind that this first Index will take you probably several weeks or even months to understand completely. This is perfectly normal so don't give up ! If you survive the Index One the next ones will be way easier.

You can learn any of the technologies below in the order you want. If you want to look for additional material to learn C++ feel free to do so !

## __First : C++__

Link to the course : [learncpp.com](https://learncpp.com/)

Please finish the first 20 chapters, at your own pace. The last chapters are optional and we don't recommend them right now. You can always come back and check them if you want to get even better at C++, but is is not useful for us at this stage.

To help you understand everything, and if you prefer to learn through videos, you can check the following course : [TODO]

Once you feel pretty confident, try to do the following assignment : [Index One Final Project](https://github.com/haysberg/index/blob/main/assignments/Index_1/final_assignment.pdf)

If you cannot finish the assignment just now or if you feel lost, don't lost hope and go back to studying. If you're finished every single course offered in this page, just spend more time on it or ask questions ! You can do it !

## __Second : Git__

Link to the course : [Git - The simple guide](https://rogerdudler.github.io/git-guide/)

Git will be useful for us, in order to save our code somewhere. It is also the de-facto standard when it comes to [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control). If you ever end up landing a programming job in a company, you __will__ be using Git.

That's actually a good thing. You don't have to learn a ton of different ways of saving your code and collaborating with others. Mastering Git is all you need.

I recommend using the default `git` utility in your terminal at first, to learn the first useful commands. You can also use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) if you wish, but it's a bad idea if you are trying to learn, so use it with caution.

## __Third : Linux__

Link to the course : [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/)

You can start by doing only the *Grasshopper* section of the website. This will teach you how to install programs, and how to navigate in your files. Combining this with the `git` course and you should be able to fully use your terminal while writing code.
